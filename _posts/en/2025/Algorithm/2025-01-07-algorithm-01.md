### **How to Solve Algorithm Problems Independently**

To improve your ability to solve algorithm problems, encountering a wide variety of problems is beneficial. However, the skill to solve new problems on your own is equally important. I aim to develop the ability to understand problems and devise appropriate solutions even when faced with unfamiliar challenges. 

In this article, I summarize the **step-by-step process of solving algorithm problems independently** and explore ways to practice effectively and consistently.

## **1. Starting with Problem Analysis**

### **1.1 Understanding the Problem Properly**

1. **Read the Problem**
   - Carefully read the problem statement and clearly identify the input and output conditions.
   - Try solving the given examples manually to better understand the problem's intent.

2. **Ask Key Questions**
   - "What am I trying to find?"
   - "What constraints do I have?"
   - "What is the size of the input data?"

> **Example**: "Find combinations of k elements from numbers 1 to n."  
> - What to find: Combinations  
> - Constraints: Choose exactly k numbers  
> - Input size: Depending on the value of n, consider time complexity.

### **1.2 Breaking the Problem into Smaller Inputs**

Use small input values to manually solve the problem and identify patterns. This approach helps you conceptualize the structural flow of the solution.

> **Example**  
> - Input: `n = 4, k = 2`  
> - Manual Calculation: `[1, 2], [1, 3], [1, 4], [2, 3], [2, 4], [3, 4]`  
> - Pattern Discovered: **Select the current number, then recursively create combinations from the remaining numbers.**

## **2. Devising a Solution Strategy**

### **2.1 Analyzing Problem Types**

Algorithm problems often fall into recurring **patterns or types**. When analyzing the problem, what would be the most suitable approach?

#### **Common Problem Types and Strategies**
1. **Optimization Problems** (Dynamic Programming, DP)
   - "When seeking the minimum or maximum value, divide the problem into smaller units and solve."
2. **Exhaustive Search Problems** (Backtracking)
   - "Explore all possible choices and eliminate paths that do not meet the conditions."
3. **Search Problems** (Graph Search, BFS/DFS)
   - "Search connected nodes in a graph while meeting specific conditions."
4. **Data Organization Problems** (Sorting, Binary Search)
   - "Organize data or efficiently search for values in a sorted dataset."

#### **Example**
- Combination generation → Use **Backtracking**.
- Array-specific sum problem → Use **Two Pointers** or **Backtracking**.

---

### **2.2 Breaking Problems into Smaller Units**

Rather than solving the entire problem at once, divide it into smaller units and solve them step by step.

1. **Determine Current Actions**
   - "Decide whether to select a number or not."
2. **Pass the Problem to the Next Step**
   - "After selecting a number, recursively generate combinations from the remaining numbers."

#### **Example**
Problem: Find 2-element combinations from `[1, 2, 3]`.
1. Select the first number: `[1]` → Generate combinations from `[2, 3]`.
2. Exclude the first number: Empty path → Generate combinations from `[2, 3]`.

---

## **3. Implementing the Solution in Code**

Once you understand the problem and devise a strategy, implement it in code. Start by writing `pseudo-code` if needed.

#### **Pseudo-Code Example: Combination Generation**
1. Create a result list.
2. Recursively explore paths by choosing or not choosing the current number.
3. Add paths with length \(k\) to the result list.

---

### **3.1 Debugging and Validation**
1. **Test with Small Inputs**
   - Verify the code's correctness with simple input values.
2. **Test Edge Cases**
   - Examples: Empty input, cases where \(n < k\).

---

## **4. Training Your Problem-Solving Skills**

### **4.1 Learning Patterns**
Familiarize yourself with key patterns while solving problems. Here are common patterns:

1. **Dynamic Programming (DP)**
   - Solve small problems and use their solutions for larger problems.
   - Examples: Fibonacci sequence, Knapsack problem.
2. **Backtracking**
   - Explore all possible paths that meet conditions.
   - Examples: N-Queens, Subset generation.
3. **Graph Search**
   - BFS: Shortest path search.
   - DFS: Exhaustive path search.

---

### **4.2 Solving Problems by Hand**
- Avoid jumping into coding right away. Manually solve simple inputs to identify rules and algorithms.
- This process helps conceptualize and structure the solution.

---

### **4.3 Review and Feedback**
- Revisit solved problems and try alternative approaches.
- Analyze and learn from failed attempts.

---

## **5. Tips for Easy Memorization**

1. **Key Questions**
   - "Can I break the problem into smaller units?"
   - "What are my current options at this step?"
   - "Can I prune invalid paths?"

2. **Memorize Simple Keywords**
   - Dynamic Programming: "Divide, Store, Combine!"
   - Backtracking: "Explore and Prune!"
   - Graph Search: "Breadth (BFS), Depth (DFS)!"

## **6. Conclusion**

To solve algorithm problems independently, you need to **train yourself to analyze problems and devise solution strategies**. By learning common algorithm patterns and solving problems step by step, you can expand your problem-solving ability. Although it can be challenging to stay consistent, regular practice will naturally improve your ability to solve even the most difficult problems. Keep pushing forward!
